Summary
----------------------------------
Using conditional statements and control flow, you can direct how a program behaves based on different situations or criteria, allowing for decision-making and defining specific pathways within the code.

1. Variables declaration:
    - Set up a HTML file linked to a JavaScript file in a folder named "controlFlow."
    - Create variables for userRole, accessLevel, isLoggedIn, userMessage, userType, userCategory, isAuthenticated, and authenticationStatus.

2. Implementing control flow:
    - Use if…else statements to assign access levels based on user roles.
    - Implement nested if…else statements to customize messages based on login status and user roles.
    - Utilize a switch statement to categorize users based on their type.

3. Ternary operator for authentication:
    - Use a ternary operator to determine the authentication status.
    - Depending on the value of isAuthenticated, set the authenticationStatus as "Authenticated" or "Not authenticated."

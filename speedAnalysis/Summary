Summary
---------------------------
1. Interface setup and functionality establishment: 
    You created a web-based typing test interface using HTML and JavaScript. The HTML structure formed the groundwork for text display (inputText), user input (userInput), and a dynamic button (Start Test).

2. Test execution and result analysis: 
    Clicking the "Start Test" button prompted users to type a predetermined text snippet in the designated input area. Upon test completion, the code swiftly calculated and displayed essential typing metrics, such as words typed, time elapsed, and words per minute (WPM), providing immediate insights into the user's typing proficiency.

3. User experience and iterative learning: 
    You created a practical platform to practice typing skills in a controlled environment. You also created immediate feedback on typing speed and accuracy, enabling users to assess their performance, facilitating iterative learning, and improving typing proficiency.

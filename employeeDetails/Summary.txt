Summary
--------------------------
1. Setting up the environment: 
    HTML code includes three <div> to showcase employee information based on user-triggered actions without the page dynamically reloading when clicking any buttons.

2. Defining variables and functions: 
    The map method stores employees' details in the variable totalEmployees, which shows details in the <div> element (with the help of an ID) displays employee information on the webpage while the reduce method iterates through each employee and accumulates their salaries to calculate the total.

3. Checking the output: 
    git add, git commit, and git push commands update changes into your Scope_Lab folder; GitHub repository for proper code management.

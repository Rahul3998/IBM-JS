Summary
-----------------------------
1. Setting Up the Environment: 
    HTML structure with a header displaying the account holder's name (Peter Parker) and a follower count displayed as "0" within a span element.

2. Defining Variables and Functions: 
    A button triggers the "increaseCount()" function, incrementing the follower count when clicked, updating the displayed count dynamically, and triggering alerts at 10 and 20 follower milestones.

3. Displaying Incremental Result: 
    JavaScript functions manage the count incrementation, display of follower count on the HTML page, and the conditional display of congratulatory messages for specific follower milestones (10 and 20 followers).

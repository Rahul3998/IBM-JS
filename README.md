# Travel Recommendation Website (IBM Project)

A simple multi-page website built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It helps users discover destinations
with sections for **Beaches**, **Temples**, and **Country-based** recommendations.

This template matches the rubric in your screenshots:

- Home, About Us, Contact Us pages
- Navigation bar on every page
- Home page introduction
- About page details
- Contact page with email form (client-side validation, success message)
- Beach recommendation with two images
- Temple recommendation with two images
- Country-based recommendation with two images

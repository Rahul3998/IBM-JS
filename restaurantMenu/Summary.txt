Summary
---------------------------
1. HTML structure:
    Defines an HTML structure for a restaurant menu, categorizing items into Breakfast, Main Course, and Dessert sections using appropriate <h2> headings and <div> elements with unique IDs for content display.

2. JavaScript dynamic content: 
    Utilizes JavaScript to dynamically populate menu items within their respective sections.
        - Breakfast menu: Uses the map method to generate HTML strings for breakfast items and inserts them into the designated <div> element.
        - Main course menu: Utilizes forEach to construct HTML strings for main course items, updating the related <div> with the generated content.
        - Dessert menu: Utilizes a for loop to create HTML strings for dessert items and inserts them into the designated <div> element for dessert items.

3. Data handling: 
    Stores menu item data in separate JavaScript arrays (breakfastMenu, mainCourseMenu, dessertMenu) to facilitate dynamic content creation without hardcoding within the HTML structure.

4. Dynamic rendering: 
    Illustrates how JavaScript interacts with HTML, dynamically generating and updating content within the webpage, demonstrating different iteration methods to present menu items under specific categories.
